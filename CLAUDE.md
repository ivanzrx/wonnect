## Project Status

This is an early-stage project named "wonnect". The repository currently contains minimal structure and will need to be expanded as development progresses.

## Development Commands

*To be updated when project structure is established*

The project does not yet have:
- Package manager configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build scripts
- Test runners  
- Linting tools

When these are added, update this section with the relevant commands.

## Project Structure

Currently minimal:
```
wonnect/

└── CLAUDE.md
```

## Architecture Notes

*To be documented as the codebase develops*

## Git Workflow

- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for development
- Review changes before merging

## Future Development

When expanding this project:
1. Add package manager configuration
2. Set up build/test/lint scripts
3. Create source code directories
4. Update this CLAUDE.md with specific commands and architecture details
5. Document any specific patterns or conventions established
